// Retro cloud-filing nudge decision (ticket BNGK9W, issue #568).
//
// PATH B: sanitized drafts that remain after the code-owned filing attempt stay
// SPOOLED (lib/retro-draft-spool.ts), and the live agent can file them via its
// inherited GitHub access. The async Stop hook that spools them is backgrounded
// and surfaces nothing (ZFGWS1), so a SEPARATE surfacing-capable boundary hook
// (SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit) checks for unfiled drafts and emits ONE factual
// line — a system-reminder the model reads, invisible to the user in chat.
//
// Muted by design (user steer 2026-07-01): the line is a STATEMENT, never an
// imperative — imperative phrasing trips Claude's prompt-injection defenses and gets
// surfaced verbatim instead of acted on (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks).
//
// Fires ONCE per unfiled batch: a persisted, signature-keyed marker is compared to
// the current unfiled set on every (fresh) evaluation, so an unchanged batch stays
// silent while a batch that GAINS a draft nudges again. Self-contained (node:* only)
// so both the CLI and the customer-repo hook can run it — like lib/self-report.ts.
