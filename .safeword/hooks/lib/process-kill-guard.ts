// Broad process-kill detection (ticket K4STDR, issue #773).
//
// `killall node` / `pkill -9 node` match processes by NAME across the whole
// machine — on a multi-project box they kill every project's dev servers,
// test runners, and build processes, not just this project's. This predicate
// detects a killall/pkill invocation whose target is a bare shared-runtime
// name so the Bash gate can deny it and point to the project-scoped
// alternatives in zombie-process-cleanup.md (port-scoped `lsof -ti:<port>`,
// path-scoped `pkill -f "<pattern>.*$(pwd)"`, or cleanup-zombies.sh).
//
// ## Detection limits (deliberate — this is not a shell parser)
//
// The predicate classifies literal tokens, same doctrine as
// bash-ledger-writes.ts: close the low-friction accident path, not every
// adversarial path. Undetected forms (all deliberate, adversarial-path) include
// targets materialized at runtime (`p=node; killall "$p"`), scripts that embed
// the kill, `xargs killall`, `env -S 'killall node'` (GNU split-string is not re-tokenized), and
// sudo compositions where a skippable prefix follows sudo (`sudo env killall
// node`, `sudo -u <user> killall node` — commandWordIndex does not model sudo or
// its option values, so only a leading `sudo` run is stripped, after prefix
// resolution).
// A quoted regex that anchors a bare name (`pkill '^node$'`) IS detected —
// anchors are stripped before the name comparison. So is a backslash-escape
// (`pkill '\java'`, `pkill 'n\ode'`): a backslash before an ordinary character
// in an ERE is undefined per POSIX and engine-dependent (glibc/BSD commonly
// yield the literal char), so bareName strips ALL backslashes as a deliberate
// conservative over-approximation — the guard over-matches rather than letting
// an inserted backslash evade it (EDDABK).
