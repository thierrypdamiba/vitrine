// Per-session JSONL spool I/O — the shared machinery under the self-report spool
// (lib/self-report.ts) and the retro draft spool (lib/retro-draft-spool.ts).
//
// Both persist sanitized, per-session records to `.safeword/<dir>/<session>.jsonl`
// and had their own copy of: count non-blank lines, read-and-skip-torn-lines,
// cap-aware append, and atomic (temp+rename) rewrite. That machinery is
// correctness-sensitive (torn-tolerance, fail-open, whole-or-nothing writes), so it
// lives here ONCE. Callers keep what genuinely differs — the subdir, the filename
// sanitizer, the record schema (parse/serialize), and the cap value — and pass a
// resolved file path in.
//
// Self-contained (node:* only) so the CLI's src/ and the customer-repo hooks can
// both run it, like the two spools it backs.
