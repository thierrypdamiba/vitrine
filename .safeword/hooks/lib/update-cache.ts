/**
 * Shared types and helpers for `.safeword/.update-cache.json`.
 *
 * The cache is written and read by session-auto-upgrade.ts, which refreshes it
 * with a 24h-throttled npm registry fetch and gates upgrade decisions on it.
 *
 * `releaseAgeStatus` is the supply-chain defense: it returns whether a
 * version is too freshly published to auto-install. Mirrors pnpm's
 * `minimumReleaseAge` (https://pnpm.io/supply-chain-security) — the
 * 24h window lets the community detect and yank malicious releases
 * before they auto-propagate.
 *
 * Supply-chain threat model
 * -------------------------
 * Auto-upgrade installs a published npm package on the user's machine with no
 * human in the loop, so its defenses are layered:
 *
 * - postinstall RCE → closed by Bun: `bun`/`bunx` do NOT run a dependency's
 *   lifecycle scripts by default (https://bun.com/docs/pm/lifecycle), so a
 *   malicious `postinstall` never executes on install.
 * - tampered/corrupted tarball (a proxy or MITM serving bytes that don't match
 *   the published metadata) → closed by the SRI integrity hash Bun checks before
 *   extraction (https://bun.com/docs/pm/cli/install): the tarball bytes must
 *   match the registry's `dist.integrity`. Note this is a content hash, not a
 *   signature — it does not by itself prove the *publisher* is authentic (see the
 *   residual below).
 * - injection via the version string → closed at the call site: `latest` is
 *   validated as plain semver and passed to `execFileSync` (no shell) in
 *   session-auto-upgrade.ts.
 * - yank window → narrowed by `releaseAgeStatus`: the 24h cooldown holds back
 *   versions published < 24h ago, giving the community time to pull a bad one.
 *
 * Accepted residual: a *valid but malicious* publish — an attacker with a leaked
 * npm token or compromised CI who pushes authentic-looking metadata and waits
 * out the 24h cooldown. safeword publishes with OIDC provenance
 * (.github/workflows/release.yml), which cryptographically attests the build came
 * from this repo's release workflow — but the client does NOT verify that
 * attestation before applying. Client-side verification (`npm audit signatures`,
 * sigstore/cosign) is an out-of-band, heavyweight dependency that doesn't fit a
 * bun-run session-start hook, and the probability is low given trusted publishing
 * plus the layers above. Deferred deliberately (ticket XQ9CXA item 3). Revisit if
 * safeword ships to higher-assurance customers, or if bun/npm expose a one-call
 * provenance check at install time.
