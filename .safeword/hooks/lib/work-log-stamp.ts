// Phase work-log stamp helpers (ticket E32M4P, issue #772).
//
// The bdd phase files used to end with "add a work-log entry" templates whose
// `{timestamp}` an LLM cannot know — transition timestamps were fabricated.
// These helpers let a PostToolUse observer reconstruct the transition from the
// edit payload and append a line stamped with the real system clock. The hook
// owns that/when (the transition line); agent narrative entries remain the
// agent's own.
//
// ## Detection limits (deliberate)
//
// The transition is reconstructed from Edit/MultiEdit payload strings — the
// only channel that still carries prior content at PostToolUse time. A
// full-file Write rewrite carries no old text, so its from-phase is
// unknowable post-hoc: Write payloads detect nothing by design. A phase
// introduced where the old payload had none is a birth, not a transition,
// and is likewise not stamped.
