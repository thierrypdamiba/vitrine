// Retro draft spool (ticket BNGK9W — cloud filing transport).
//
// The invisible retro extracts + sanitizes findings into code-assembled drafts,
// then tries to file them via the REST transport. The spool persists POST-EGRESS
// drafts before that attempt so anything unfiled survives a missing credential,
// upstream failure, filing cap, or acknowledgement failure. The agent-filing path
// (PATH B) reads the spool and
// posts each draft verbatim via its inherited GitHub MCP, then marks them filed.
//
// Only the code-assembled draft ({signature, title, body, labels}) is written —
// it is already sanitized at egress, so no raw finding text reaches disk.
//
// The per-session JSONL I/O (append+cap, read-skip-torn, atomic rewrite) lives in
// lib/jsonl-spool.ts, shared with the self-report spool; this module owns only what
// is retro-specific: the subdir, the draft schema, and the drain/filing semantics.
// Self-contained (node:* only): the CLI's `src/` imports it AND the surfacing hook
// runs it under bun in a customer repo. `SpooledDraft` is structurally `RetroDraft`.
