// Safeword: self-observation surfacing (ticket QYYC5Y, issue #345).
//
// At the end of a turn, if safeword captured any of its OWN internal signals
// this session (see lib/self-report.ts), surface a factual one-liner to Claude
// via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext on exit 0. Phrased as a statement of
// fact — never an imperative — because out-of-band/command phrasing trips
// Claude's prompt-injection defenses and gets surfaced verbatim instead of acted
// on (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks). Best-effort: never blocks Stop.
//
// EMIT ONLY ON CHANGE (issue #1163). Stop additionalContext wakes the agent as a
// fresh turn with no user message; the agent must say something to end that turn,
// which fires Stop again. So an unconditional emit from a Stop hook is an
// infinite wake-loop generator, and the session spool never drains — every Stop
// would re-surface a byte-identical line. Each signature is therefore surfaced at
// most once per session, tracked in the `surfaced/` marker; a Stop with nothing
// new emits nothing at all.
