## Test Philosophy

**Behavior-biased testing:** At every test level, assert on what the system _does_ (outputs, side effects, user-visible outcomes) — never on _how_ it does it (internal state, mock call counts, private methods). Tests coupled to implementation break on every refactor. Behavioral tests survive.

**Maximize confidence per cost:** When multiple test types can verify a
behavior, prefer the highest-scope proof that is stable and cheap enough for
the lane. Higher scope gives more real-world confidence. Lower scope wins when
it proves the same behavior faster, diagnoses failures better, or covers dense
edge cases.

Test what you build — run the tests yourself before completion rather than asking the user to verify.

---

## Test Integrity

**NEVER modify, skip, or delete tests without explicit human approval.**

Tests are the specification. When a test fails, the implementation is wrong—not the test.

### Forbidden Actions (Require Approval)

| Action                                       | Why It's Forbidden                |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Changing assertions to match broken code     | Hides bugs instead of fixing them |
| Deleting tests you can't get passing         | Removes coverage for edge cases   |
| Weakening assertions (`toBe` → `toBeTruthy`) | Reduces test precision            |

Skipping, focusing, deferring, or commenting out tests is lint-denied in the
vitest lane (`vitest/no-disabled-tests`, `no-focused-tests`,
`no-commented-out-tests`, plus the deferred-marker selector). The sanctioned
escape hatch is an inline eslint-disable with a reason — that comment is the
auditable approval artifact. Environment-conditional `skipIf`/`runIf` stay
legal.

### What To Do Instead

1. **Test fails?** → Fix the implementation, not the test
2. **Test seems wrong?** → Explain why and ask before updating
3. **Requirements changed?** → Explain the change and ask before updating tests
4. **Test is flaky?** → Fix the flakiness (usually async issues), don't skip it
5. **Test blocks progress?** → Ask for guidance, don't work around it

---

## Test Value Model

**Rule:** Test value = customer-behavior confidence / run + maintenance cost.

Use higher-scope tests for risks only the real system can expose. Use
lower-scope tests when they give the same behavioral proof faster, make failures
easier to diagnose, or cover many input combinations.

| Test Type   | Highest Value When                                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| E2E         | Critical user journeys, browser behavior, deployment confidence  |
| Integration | Product behavior crosses modules, services, APIs, storage, state |
| Unit        | Pure logic, validators, calculations, dense edge cases           |
| LLM Eval    | AI output quality cannot be proven deterministically             |
| Static gate | Types, lint, schema, formatting, dependency rules                |

---

## Good Test Or Busywork

A good test protects behavior that matters and would fail for a plausible
regression. A busywork test satisfies "add tests" without raising useful
confidence.

A test earns its place only if every one of these holds; the first that fails
tells you what to fix before writing it.

1. **What behavior or contract does this protect?**
   - Clear answer → Continue
   - No clear answer → Do not write the test; define the behavior first

2. **What plausible regression would make this test fail?**
   - Clear answer → Continue
   - No clear answer → Skip it or turn it into a clearer acceptance criterion

3. **Is this the cheapest scope that proves the behavior?**
   - YES → Continue
   - NO → Move up or down the hierarchy until confidence and cost match

4. **Will a failure point to a likely fix area?**
   - YES → Continue
   - NO → Narrow the test, improve assertions, or add better failure evidence

5. **Is the test stable, isolated, and owned?**
   - YES → Keep the test
   - NO → Fix fixture isolation, flake risk, cleanup, or ownership first

### Good Test Signals

| Signal                    | What It Means                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Behavior-linked           | Protects an output, side effect, workflow, or contract  |
| Plausible regression      | Would fail for a bug users or maintainers could hit     |
| Cheapest sufficient scope | Uses no more system than needed to prove the behavior   |
| Diagnosable failure       | Failure narrows where to inspect next                   |
| Stable and isolated       | Does not depend on order, shared state, timing, or luck |
| Maintained evidence       | Fixtures, snapshots, and assertions stay intentional    |

### Busywork Smells By Type

| Test Type   | Busywork Smell                                         | Better Move                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | Private methods, mock-call choreography, pass-throughs | Test public behavior or delete the test                    |
| Integration | So many mocks that the boundary is fake                | Use a unit test or fewer mocks                             |
| Integration | So broad that failures only say "something broke"      | Split by contract or promote the main flow to E2E          |
| E2E         | Every edge case runs through a browser                 | Keep E2E smoke; cover edge cases lower down                |
| E2E         | Fragile shared accounts, third-party UI, or timing     | Isolate data, stub unsafe boundaries, add waits on signals |
| Static gate | Noisy rule treated as behavior proof                   | Keep static gates, but add runtime coverage                |
| LLM Eval    | Deterministic assertion disguised as model judgment    | Use the eval guide's token-waste gate                      |

Good test:

```text
Behavior: User cannot lose a draft after validation fails.
Regression: Form reset clears unsaved input.
Scope: Integration test with the form, validation, and state store.
Failure action: inspect submit handler and draft persistence.
```

Busywork test:

```text
Behavior: unclear.
Regression: "component should work."
Scope: E2E test clicking through a happy path already covered by smoke.
Failure action: unclear.
```

If a test fails this gate, convert it into one of:

- A clearer acceptance criterion
- A smaller unit or integration test
- A critical-path E2E smoke test
- An eval idea with a specific AI failure named
- A verification lane with cadence, owner, and failure action

---

## Test Type Hierarchy

**Rule:** Prefer the highest-scope type that is stable and cheap enough for the
lane. Higher scope increases confidence in real behavior; lower scope is better
for fast diagnosis, pure algorithms, and combinatorial input coverage.

```text
E2E (seconds-minutes)    ← Full browser, user flows         ↑ broader confidence
  ↑
LLM Eval (seconds+)      ← AI judgment, model-dependent cost
  ↑
Integration (seconds)    ← Multiple modules, database, API
  ↑
Unit (milliseconds)      ← Pure functions, no I/O           ↓ cheaper diagnosis
```

---

## When to Use Each Test Type

The first matching row picks the type (rows run general → specific):

| If the test…                                                      | Type           | Examples                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| checks AI-generated content quality (tone, reasoning, creativity) | LLM Evaluation |                                                                                                                                            |
| needs a real browser (Playwright/Cypress)                         | E2E            | Multi-page navigation, browser-specific behavior, visual regression (React Testing Library does _not_ need a browser — that's integration) |
| exercises interactions between multiple components/services       | Integration    | API + database, React component + state store                                                                                              |
| covers a pure function (input → output, no I/O)                   | Unit           | Calculations, formatters, validators, pure algorithms                                                                                      |

If none match, re-evaluate what you're actually testing.

**Edge cases:**

- Non-deterministic functions (Math.random, Date.now) → Unit test with mocked randomness
- Functions with environment dependencies (process.env) → Integration test
- Mixed pure + I/O logic → Extract pure logic, unit test it, integration test I/O
- DOM tests with jsdom or Testing Library → Integration test unless the bug
  depends on real browser layout, CSS, navigation, or browser APIs

## Bug Detection Matrix

Which test type catches which bug?

| Bug Type                             | Unit? | Integration? | E2E? | Best Choice     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- | ------------ | ---- | --------------- |
| Calculation error                    | ✅    | ✅           | ✅   | Unit (fastest)  |
| Invalid input handling               | ✅    | ✅           | ✅   | Unit (fastest)  |
| Database query returning wrong data  | ❌    | ✅           | ✅   | Integration     |
| API endpoint contract violation      | ❌    | ✅           | ✅   | Integration     |
| Race condition between services      | ❌    | ✅           | ✅   | Integration     |
| State management bug                 | ❌    | ✅           | ✅   | Integration     |
| React component rendering wrong data | ❌    | ✅           | ✅   | Integration     |
| CSS layout broken                    | ❌    | ❌           | ✅   | E2E (only)      |
| Multi-page navigation broken         | ❌    | ❌           | ✅   | E2E (only)      |
| Browser-specific rendering           | ❌    | ❌           | ✅   | E2E (only)      |
| AI prompt quality degradation        | ❌    | ❌           | ❌   | LLM Eval (only) |
| AI reasoning accuracy                | ❌    | ❌           | ❌   | LLM Eval (only) |

**Key principle:** If multiple test types can catch the bug, prefer the highest scope that's practical. Use lower scope for pure logic with many edge cases.

## TDD Quick Reference (Tasks)

For tasks (1-2 files), follow this cycle:

1. **RED** - Write one failing test for the expected behavior
2. **GREEN** - Write minimum code to pass the test
3. **REFACTOR** - Clean up, run `/refactor` if needed

Commit after each GREEN phase.

### Escalation Check

If during implementation you discover:

- 3+ files need changes, OR
- Multiple user flows affected, OR
- New state management needed

**Stop and escalate:** "This is bigger than expected. Switching to `/bdd` for proper behavior definition."

For full TDD workflow with verification gates, red flags, walking skeleton, and phase orchestration, start feature work or run `/bdd`.

---

## Test Type Examples

### Unit Tests

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Pure function
it('applies 20% discount for VIP users', () => {
  expect(calculateDiscount(100, { tier: 'VIP' })).toBe(80);
});

// ❌ BAD - Testing implementation details
it('calls setState with correct value', () => {
  expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ count: 1 });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```typescript
describe('Agent + State Integration', () => {
  it('updates character state after agent processes action', async () => {
    const agent = new GameAgent();
    const store = useGameStore.getState();

    await agent.processAction('attack guard');

    expect(store.character.stress).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(store.messages).toHaveLength(2);
  });
});
```

### E2E Tests

```typescript
test('user creates account and first item', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/signup');
  await page.fill('[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('[name="password"]', 'secure123');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Sign Up")');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');

  await page.click('text=New Item');
  await page.fill('[name="title"]', 'My First Item');
  await page.click('text=Save');
  await expect(page.getByText('My First Item')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### LLM Evaluations

```yaml
- description: 'Infer user intent from casual input'
  vars:
    input: 'I want to order a large pepperoni'
  assert:
    - type: javascript
      value: JSON.parse(output).intent === 'order_pizza'
    - type: llm-rubric
      value: |
        PASS: Correctly identifies pizza order, confirms size and type
        FAIL: Wrong intent, ignores key details, or generic response
```

---

## E2E Testing with Persistent Dev Servers

Isolate persistent dev instances from test instances to avoid port conflicts.

**Port Isolation Strategy:**

- **Dev instance**: Project's configured port (e.g., 3000) - runs persistently
- **Test instances**: `devPort + 1000` (e.g., 4000) - managed by Playwright

**Playwright Configuration:**

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: {
    command: 'bun run dev:test',
    port: 4000,
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 120000,
  },
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:4000',
  },
});
```

**Package.json Scripts:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite --port 3000",
    "dev:test": "vite --port 4000",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test"
  }
}
```

**Cleanup:** See `.safeword/guides/zombie-process-cleanup.md` for killing zombie servers.

## Writing Effective Tests

### AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

```typescript
it('applies discount to VIP users', () => {
  const user = { tier: 'VIP' },
    cart = { total: 100 }; // Arrange
  const result = applyDiscount(user, cart); // Act
  expect(result.total).toBe(80); // Assert
});
```

### Test Naming

Be descriptive and specific:

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD
it('returns 401 when API key is missing');
it('preserves user input after validation error');

// ❌ BAD
it('works correctly');
it('should call setState');
```

### Test Independence

Each test should:

- Run in any order
- Not depend on other tests
- Clean up its own state
- Use fresh fixtures/data

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Fresh state per test
beforeEach(() => {
  gameState = createFreshGameState();
});

// ❌ BAD - Shared state
let sharedUser = createUser();
it('test A', () => {
  sharedUser.name = 'Alice';
});
it('test B', () => {
  expect(sharedUser.name).toBe('Alice'); // Depends on A!
});
```

### Test Data Builders

Use builders for complex test data:

```typescript
function buildCharacter(overrides = {}) {
  return {
    id: 'test-char-1',
    name: 'Cutter',
    playbook: 'Cutter',
    stress: 0,
    ...overrides,
  };
}

it('should increase stress when resisting', () => {
  const character = buildCharacter({ stress: 3 });
  // Test uses character with stress=3
});
```

### Async Testing

Arbitrary sleeps are lint-denied (`no-restricted-syntax` sleep selectors in the
vitest lane; `playwright/no-wait-for-timeout` in the e2e lane). Poll an
observable condition instead:

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Poll until condition
await expect.poll(() => getStatus()).toBe('ready');
await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="loaded"]');
await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByText('Success')).toBeVisible());
```

## Upstream Workaround Tripwires

A workaround for someone else's bug is temporary by intent and permanent in
practice. The usual safeguards fail quietly: a code comment only reaches
someone already reading that file, a ticket ages out of triage, and a
scheduled reminder is tied to something that ends — a PR, a session, a
person. The workaround outlives its cause, and the next person to touch it
sees pointless-looking indirection and "cleans it up," silently reintroducing
the original bug.

**Pattern:** when you write a workaround for an upstream bug, write a test
that fails when the workaround becomes _removable_. The test asserts the
dependency is still pinned at the last known-bad version. The next upgrade
turns CI red, with a failure message naming exactly what to delete.

It fires on the event that makes the workaround removable rather than on a
clock or a memory. It survives the PR merging, the ticket closing, and the
author leaving.

### When A Tripwire Is Warranted

Both must hold:

| Condition                                 | Why                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Removal depends on someone else's release | Nothing in this repo will ever tell you the fix shipped                 |
| The failure mode is silent                | Nobody notices the workaround rotting, or a cleanup reintroducing a bug |

A workaround for something obvious and loud does not need one. Neither does
one you can delete today.

### Assert The Version, Not The Bug

This inversion is the whole trick.

A test that reproduces the bug goes **green** when upstream fixes it —
silently, telling nobody, leaving the dead workaround behind. A test that
asserts the pin goes **red** on the upgrade, in front of the person doing the
upgrade, at the moment the decision is theirs to make.

```ts
// ❌ Asserts the bug — passes silently once upstream fixes it
test('adapter still ships unoptimized images', () => {
  expect(buildOutput.images.every(isOptimized)).toBe(false);
});

// ✅ Asserts the pin — fails on the upgrade that makes removal possible
/** Newest @astrojs/cloudflare known to still need the workaround. */
const PINNED_VERSION = '14.1.7';

test(`adapter is still pinned to ${PINNED_VERSION} — see this file's header before changing`, () => {
  expect(adapterPkg.version).toBe(PINNED_VERSION);
});
```

### The Header Is The Deliverable

The failure message wakes someone with no context. The file header is what
they read next, so it carries the runbook:

- **The bug** — what breaks, how it presents, and why it is silent
- **The workaround** — what this repo does instead
- **Fix shipped** — the exact files to delete, including this test
- **Not fixed yet** — re-pin and bump `PINNED_VERSION`; a red test is the
  check working
- **Why the obvious cleanup is wrong** — when a plausible simplification
  reintroduces the bug, say so where the person deleting it will read

Scaffold: `.safeword/templates/tripwire-template.md`. Write it while the
context is fresh — the header is the part that is easy to under-write and
impossible to reconstruct later.

### Cost And Lane

A tripwire runs in the **static gate** lane: cheap, every CI run, fires on
dependency change rather than on a schedule. When the fix is not in the next
release the upgrader gets a red test, checks the upstream issue, and re-pins.
That is correct behavior, not friction — they should be checking.

---

## What Not to Test

❌ **Implementation details** - Private methods, CSS classes, internal state
❌ **Third-party libraries** - Assume React/Axios work, test YOUR code
❌ **Trivial code** - Getters/setters with no logic, pass-through functions
❌ **Incidental UI copy** - Marketing/help text when exact wording is not the
contract

**Copy assertions:**

- Prefer role/name or resilient regex for controls
- Assert exact text for legal, safety, error, or required user-facing messages

---

## Coverage Goals

- **Unit tests:** 80%+ coverage of pure functions and dense edge cases
- **Integration tests:** All critical paths covered
- **E2E tests:** Critical multi-page user flows and browser-only risks
- **LLM evals:** AI features with probabilistic output quality have evaluation scenarios; deterministic AI plumbing has normal tests

**What are "critical paths"?**

- **Always critical:** Authentication, payment/checkout, data loss scenarios
- **Usually critical:** Core user workflows, primary feature flows
- **Rarely critical:** UI polish, admin-only features with low usage
- **Rule of thumb:** If it breaks, would users notice immediately?

---

## LLM Eval Cost Considerations

**Cost:** Model-, prompt-, provider-, and scenario-dependent. Estimate from
current provider pricing before deciding cadence.

**Prompt caching can reduce repeated input-token costs on supported providers.**
OpenAI currently documents up to 90% input-token savings for qualifying cached
prompts. Treat caching as provider-specific, not guaranteed.

**Cost reduction strategies:**

- Cache static content (system prompts, examples, rules)
- Batch multiple scenarios in one run
- Split cheap smoke evals from full eval suites
- Run full evals on PR, release, or schedule only when the signal is worth the cost

---

## CI/CD Integration

- Run unit + integration tests on every commit (fast feedback)
- Run E2E smoke tests on every PR; run broader E2E suites on release or schedule
- Run smoke evals on PR for high-risk AI behavior; run full evals on release or schedule

---
