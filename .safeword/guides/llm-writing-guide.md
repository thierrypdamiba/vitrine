# LLM Writing Guide

How to write documentation that LLMs will read and follow: CLAUDE.md, SAFEWORD.md, guides, skills, commands, hooks.

## Core Principles

### 1. MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

Decision trees must have no overlap and cover all cases.

```markdown
❌ BAD - Overlapping:
├─ Pure function?
├─ Multiple components?
├─ Full user flow?

✅ GOOD - Sequential, stop at first match:

1. AI content quality? → LLM Eval
2. Requires real browser? → E2E test
3. Multiple components? → Integration test
4. Pure function? → Unit test
```

### 2. Explicit Over Implicit

Define all terms. Never assume LLMs know what you mean.

```markdown
❌ BAD: "Test at the lowest level"
✅ GOOD: "Test with the fastest test type that can catch the bug"

Define: "Critical paths" → auth, payment (always); UI polish (rarely)
Define: "Browser" → Real browser (Playwright), not jsdom
```

### 3. Concrete Examples Over Abstract Rules

For every rule, include 2-3 good vs bad examples.

```markdown
❌ BAD: "Follow best practices for testing"

✅ GOOD:
// ❌ Testing business logic with E2E (slow)
test('discount', async ({ page }) => { await page.goto('/checkout')... })

// ✅ Unit test (fast)
it('applies 20% discount', () => { expect(calculateDiscount(100, 0.20)).toBe(80) })
```

### 4. Edge Cases Must Be Explicit

After stating a rule, add edge cases.

```markdown
Rule: "Unit test pure functions"

Edge cases:

- Math.random(), Date.now() → Unit test with mocked randomness/time
- process.env dependencies → Integration test
- Mixed pure + I/O → Extract pure part, unit test separately
```

### 5. No Contradictions

Different sections must align. Grep for related terms when updating.

```markdown
❌ Section A: "E2E tests only for critical paths"
Section B: "All user-facing features have E2E tests"

✅ Both sections use same definition of "critical"
```

## Decision Tree Patterns

### Declarative Table Over Ordered Scan

A literal model resolves a lookup in one glance, so prefer a declarative "first
matching row applies" table over an ordered "answer in order, stop at first
match" scan — the scan makes the model serially walk rows it already sees at
once. Keep the rows mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. Reserve
ordered steps for a genuinely sequential _procedure_, where each step depends on
the result of the one before.

```markdown
❌ BAD - ordered scan of mutually-exclusive rows:
Answer IN ORDER, stop at first match:

1. Pure function? → Unit
2. Multiple components? → Integration
3. Full user flow? → E2E

✅ GOOD - declarative table, first matching row applies:

| If the test…               | Type        |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| covers a pure function     | Unit        |
| spans multiple components  | Integration |
| exercises a full user flow | E2E         |
```

### Tie-Breaking Rules

When multiple options apply, tell LLMs how to choose.

```markdown
"If multiple test types can catch the bug, choose the fastest one."
```

### Lookup Tables for Complex Decisions

When 3+ branches exist, provide a table.

```markdown
| Bug Type          | Unit? | Integration? | E2E? | Best Choice    |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------ | ---- | -------------- |
| Calculation error | ✅    | ✅           | ✅   | Unit (fastest) |
| Database bug      | ❌    | ✅           | ✅   | Integration    |
| CSS layout broken | ❌    | ❌           | ✅   | E2E            |
```

## Document Structure

### Position-Aware Writing

Claude 4 models show reduced positional bias — the "lost in the middle" problem is less severe. Focus on clarity over position tricks.

**Guidelines:**

- Place large reference documents at TOP with instructions below (Anthropic long-context tips)
- For short config files (CLAUDE.md, SAFEWORD.md), position matters less — focus on clear structure
- Avoid burying critical rules in the middle of long documents (still the weakest position)
- Use "Key Takeaways" sections at the end for reinforcement, not as the sole location for critical rules

### Re-evaluation Paths

Provide concrete next steps for dead ends.

```markdown
❌ BAD: "If none apply, re-evaluate"

✅ GOOD: "If doesn't fit categories:

1. Break it down: Separate pure logic from I/O/UI
2. Test each piece: Pure → Unit, I/O → Integration, Multi-page → E2E"
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't                                 | Why                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual metaphors (pyramids, icebergs) | LLMs don't process visuals                         |
| Undefined jargon                      | "Technical debt" needs definition                  |
| Percentages without context           | "70/20/10" meaningless without adjustment guidance |
| Caveats in tables                     | Parentheticals break pattern matching              |
| Critical info in middle               | Lost-in-middle phenomenon                          |

## De-prescription: convert, don't delete

Modern models (Fable 5, Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5) follow instructions more literally
than older ones, so imperative step-lists, forced ordering, and shouted
`CRITICAL/MUST` emphasis now degrade output rather than improve it. When editing
these guides, **convert prescription into principle** — state the intent, a
measurable done-condition, and the explicit scope — rather than enumerating
steps. Graduate true invariants out of prose and into hooks/lint.

This is a cross-vendor shift, not an Anthropic quirk: OpenAI's GPT-5.5 guidance
says the same — "reduce or remove detailed step-by-step process guidance… let
the model choose the path unless the product requires that path," and "describe
the expected outcome, success criteria, allowed side effects… and output shape"
instead. Treat the convention as durable, not model-of-the-month.

**Classify every edit into one of two columns:**

- **Universal** — rephrases to intent, softens an imperative, drops
  native-behavior scaffolding, or graduates an invariant into a hook. No
  guidance is lost, so **apply it globally, no A/B needed.**
- **Deletion** — removes guidance instead of restating it. A literal model
  won't infer what you cut, so this **must pass an Opus 4.8 + Sonnet 5 A/B
  before it ships globally** — never on single-model evidence.

Two more rules keep the smaller and non-Fable drivers safe:

- **Tag each finding with the model that surfaced it.** A regression seen only
  on one model isn't yet evidence for a global change.
- **Keep capability guidance as conditional "when-X" triggers, don't delete it.**
  Prompts to delegate to subagents, consult learnings, or search-first are
  scaffolding Fable doesn't need but Opus 4.8 does (it under-reaches). Phrase
  them as "when the task fans out across independent items, delegate to
  subagents" — harmless to Fable, measurable lift on Opus 4.8.
