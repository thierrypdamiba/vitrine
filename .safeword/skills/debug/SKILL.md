# Systematic Debugger

Find root cause before fixing. Symptom fixes are failure.

Investigate the root cause before attempting any fix.

## When to Use

Use for bugs, errors, test failures, unexpected behavior, repeated failed fixes,
or performance problems — skip for greenfield work.

**Use especially when:**

- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Quick fix" seems obvious (red flag)
- Already tried 1+ fixes that didn't work

## The Four Phases

Complete each phase before proceeding.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

#### 1. Read Error Messages Completely

```text
Don't skip past errors. They often contain the exact solution.
- Full stack trace (note line numbers, file paths)
- Error codes and messages
- Warnings that preceded the error
```

**When the error mentions a library/framework symbol** (a function, class, or module from a dependency) — read the installed version's docs before forming a hypothesis. Signatures, defaults, and deprecation behavior change between versions; training memory may describe a different version than the one running. Check `package.json` / lockfile, then the source wired up (Context7, official docs, README at the pinned ref).

#### 2. Reproduce Consistently

| Can reproduce?  | Action                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Yes, every time | Proceed to step 3                                    |
| Sometimes       | Gather more data - when does it happen vs not?       |
| Never           | Cannot debug what you cannot reproduce - gather logs |

**When repro hinges on user-only context** (env, timeline, "what were you doing"), call `/elicit` — its multiple-choice format constrains the answer space better than open prompts.

#### 3. Check Recent Changes

```bash
git diff HEAD~5       # Recent code changes
git log --oneline -10 # Recent commits
```

What changed that could cause this? Dependencies? Config? Environment?

#### 4. Trace Data Flow (Root Cause Tracing)

When error is deep in call stack:

```text
Symptom: Error at line 50 in utils.js
    ↑ Called by handler.js:120
    ↑ Called by router.js:45
    ↑ Called by app.js:10 ← ROOT CAUSE: bad input here
```

**Technique:**

1. Find where error occurs (symptom)
2. Ask: "What called this with bad data?"
3. Trace up until you find the SOURCE
4. Fix at source, not at symptom

#### 5. Multi-Component Systems

When system has multiple layers (API → service → database):

```bash
# Log at EACH boundary before proposing fixes
echo "=== Layer 1 (API): request=$REQUEST ==="
echo "=== Layer 2 (Service): input=$INPUT ==="
echo "=== Layer 3 (DB): query=$QUERY ==="
```

Run once to find WHERE it breaks. Then investigate that layer.

#### 6. Bisect to the Fault

When the bug appeared after some change, or lives somewhere in a large input/state, **binary-search it** instead of reading linearly. Each step halves the suspect space — a maximally-discriminating disconfirming test:

- **History:** mark the range first (`git bisect start && git bisect bad && git bisect good <known-good-ref>`), then `git bisect run <script>` — a non-interactive predicate (e.g. `bun test foo`; exit 0 = good, non-0 = bad). git finds the first bad commit for you; `git bisect reset` when done.
- **Input/state:** halve the failing input (or toggle half the config/flags) and re-test; keep the half that still fails (delta debugging).

Prefer the cheapest bisection that splits the space — it usually beats linear tracing.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

#### 1. Find Working Examples

Locate similar working code in same codebase. What works that's similar?

#### 2. Identify Differences

| Working code     | Broken code    | Could this matter? |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Uses async/await | Uses callbacks | Yes - timing       |
| Validates input  | No validation  | Yes - bad data     |

List ALL differences. Don't assume "that can't matter."

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

#### 1. Form 2–3 Competing Hypotheses

List 2–3 candidate causes, ranked by plausibility — not one. A single locked-in hypothesis invites confirmation bias; competing ones force you to discriminate ("consider the opposite" reliably reduces that bias).

Write each as "X could be root cause because Y", then ask: what evidence would _rule it out_?

- ❌ "Something's wrong with the database"
- ✅ (a) pool exhausted — connections not released on the error path; (b) pool size mis-set for this env; (c) a slow query holds connections past timeout

**Test the cheapest _disconfirming_ check first** — the one that eliminates the most candidates. Rule hypotheses _out_; don't hunt to confirm a favorite. (Bisection — Phase 1 §6 — is often the cheapest discriminator.)

#### 2. Test Minimally

| Rule                     | Why                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| ONE change at a time     | Isolate what works     |
| Smallest possible change | Avoid side effects     |
| Don't bundle fixes       | Can't tell what helped |

#### 3. Evaluate Result

| Result                | Action                                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confirms a hypothesis | Phase 4 (verify the fix)                                                    |
| Rules one out         | Eliminate it; test the next live hypothesis. None left? Form new ones (3.1) |
| Inconclusive          | Pick a more discriminating (cheaper-to-disconfirm) test                     |

### Root Cause Checkpoint

Before proceeding to Phase 4:

1. **Document root cause** in ticket (under "## Root Cause" section):
   - What is the actual cause (not symptom)?
   - Why did this happen?
   - How was it confirmed?
   - Which competing hypotheses were **ruled out**, and the disconfirming evidence for each — don't silently drop them, so a later session won't re-walk dead ends
2. **If using tickets:** Update frontmatter to `subtype: bug-investigated`

**Example:**

```markdown
## Root Cause

Connection pool exhausted because connections aren't released in error path.
Confirmed by adding pool logging - saw connections increment without decrement on errors.

Ruled out: pool size mis-set (config matches env); slow query (query times well under timeout in logs).
```

### Phase 4: Implementation

#### 1. Create Failing Test

Before fixing, write test that fails due to the bug:

```javascript
it('handles empty input without crashing', () => {
  // This test should FAIL before fix, PASS after
  expect(() => processData('')).not.toThrow();
});
```

#### 2. Implement Fix

- Address ROOT CAUSE identified in Phase 1
- ONE change
- No "while I'm here" improvements

#### 3. Root Cause Is Upstream? Ship A Tripwire With The Workaround

When the root cause lives in a dependency and the fix is a workaround — a
version pin, an avoided API, a reimplemented helper — the workaround becomes
removable on _their_ release, which nothing in this repo will ever announce.
Comments and tickets do not reach whoever holds the code then.

Add a test asserting the dependency is still pinned at the last known-bad
version, with a header naming what to delete when it fails. Assert the pin,
not the bug: a test that reproduces the bug goes green when upstream fixes
it, silently, leaving the dead workaround behind.

Warranted when removal depends on someone else's release _and_ the failure
mode is silent. Rules: `.safeword/guides/testing-guide.md` → "Upstream
Workaround Tripwires". Scaffold: `.safeword/templates/tripwire-template.md`.

#### 4. Verify

- [ ] New test passes
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
- [ ] Issue actually resolved (not just test passing)

Close the fix report with a `**Next:**` line — imperative: the commit message to use, the ticket to mark done, or a follow-up issue for related debt the investigation surfaced (the stop hook reads it for the re-entry brief).

Examples:

- **Next:** commit with `fix(auth): release pool connection in error path`, mark ticket 234 done.
- **Next:** commit the fix, then open a ticket for the unrelated logging gap surfaced at `src/auth.ts:88`.

#### 5. If Fix Doesn't Work

| Fix attempts | Action                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1-2          | Return to Phase 1 with new information   |
| 3+           | STOP - Question architecture (see below) |

#### 6. After 3+ Failed Fixes: Question Architecture

Pattern indicating architectural problem:

- Each fix reveals new coupling/shared state
- Fixes require "massive refactoring"
- Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

**STOP and ask:**

- Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
- Should we refactor vs. continue patching?
- Discuss with user before more fix attempts
- If user confirms the pattern is fundamentally unsound, call `/figure-it-out` to evaluate approaches (refactor / redesign / extract) before implementing anything.

## Red Flags - STOP Immediately

If you catch yourself thinking:

| Thought                                        | Reality                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| "Quick fix for now, investigate later"         | Investigate NOW or you never will |
| "Just try changing X"                          | That's guessing, not debugging    |
| "I'll add multiple fixes and test"             | Can't isolate what worked         |
| "I don't fully understand but this might work" | You need to understand first      |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures)     | 3+ failures = wrong approach      |

**ALL mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Quick Reference

| Phase             | Key Question                          | Success Criteria                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Root Cause     | "WHY is this happening?"              | Understand cause, not just symptom          |
| 2. Pattern        | "What's different from working code?" | Identified key differences                  |
| 3. Hypothesis     | "Which competing cause survives?"     | Ruled out alternatives; one cause confirmed |
| 4. Implementation | "Does the fix work?"                  | Test passes, issue resolved                 |
