# Define Behavior & Scenario Gate

## Define Behavior

**Entry:** Agent enters `define-behavior` phase (after discovery or resume).

### Iron Law

**DERIVE DIMENSIONS BEFORE WRITING SCENARIOS** — systematic coverage, not intuition.

### Pipeline (5 steps)

1. **Derive dimensions** from intake artifacts (resolved questions, done-when, scope) + domain-knowledge dimensions not surfaced during intake
2. **Partition** each dimension into equivalence classes + boundary values
3. **Generate scenarios** — one per partition + boundary cases. Each scenario proves a specific **Rule** (or legacy Acceptance Criterion) from intake (`spec.md`); if a scenario doesn't map to any criterion, either it's testing implementation (drop it) or a criterion is missing (go back and add it).
4. **Organize under Gherkin `Rule:` blocks** with card-ratio self-check (too many rules? any rules with no examples? open questions?). They group scenarios by the criterion they prove, so every criterion has ≥1 scenario and no scenario is an orphan.
5. **Present to user** (decider) — user accepts, tweaks, or adds

Save the dimension table to `dimensions.md` in the ticket folder before writing test-definitions.md (the pre-tool hook enforces this for features). For tiny features with one obvious behavioral dimension and no partitioning to enumerate, dimensions.md may instead be a single line `skip: <non-empty reason>`.

### Are the scenarios complete?

Ask the user: **Do these scenarios fully describe the intended behavior and important boundaries, or is anything missing?** If their feedback adds scenarios, revise the set and ask again. When they confirm nothing is missing, proceed to scenario-gate.

### Concrete example

**Context:** User asked for `--dry-run` on init. Intake produced scope (show what would be created without creating), done-when (output matches real init, no side effects).

**Agent turn 1:**

> From intake I see 2 behavioral dimensions:
>
> | Dimension              | Partitions                                    |
> | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
> | Output correctness     | empty dir, existing config, conflicting files |
> | Side-effect prevention | filesystem writes, git operations             |
>
> Organized under 3 rules:
>
> **Rule: Dry-run output matches real init**
>
> - [ ] Shows expected files in empty directory
> - [ ] Shows warning when config already exists
> - [ ] Shows conflict notice for incompatible existing files
>
> **Rule: Dry-run creates no files**
>
> - [ ] No files created on disk
>
> **Rule: Dry-run skips git operations**
>
> - [ ] No git init or git add executed
>
> 3 rules, 5 scenarios, 0 open questions. The "conflicting files" partition came from domain knowledge — init currently overwrites without warning, so dry-run should surface that. Anything missing, or ready for the quality gate?

**User:** "Looks good, proceed."

**Result:** The user confirms the intended behavior and important boundaries are fully described → proceed to scenario-gate.

### Two formats: discovery vs saved

**Discovery shorthand** (in chat, presenting to user): Rule + bare scenario checkboxes — fast to read, easy to amend in conversation. This is what turn-1 above looks like.

**Saved source** (`features/<slug>.feature`; under `paths.features` when configured): Gherkin `Feature` / `Rule` / `Scenario`, with lineage carried on the `Rule:` block as a `@<jtbd-id>.R<#>` tag that its scenarios inherit (legacy specs instead tag each scenario `@<jtbd-id>.AC<#>`). Two senses of "rule" meet here: Gherkin's `Rule:` keyword is the grouping block, while the numbered Rule (`.R<#>`) is safeword's lineage id — the block carries it as a tag and repeats it as the first token of its name. This is the executable behavior source that the Cucumber lane runs and `/review-spec`, `safeword doctor`, and `safeword project codify` read.

### Surface coverage tags

If `spec.md` `## Surfaces` lists `Affected:` entries, each affected surface needs at least one saved scenario tagged `@surface.<slug>` or an explicit `skip: <reason>` on the affected-surface line. Slug = lowercase name with non-alphanumerics collapsed to hyphens (`OpenAI Codex` -> `@surface.openai-codex`). One scenario can carry multiple surface tags when the same behavior proves parity across contexts. `safeword doctor` reports missing or stale surface tags as advisories.

**Progress ledger** (`test-definitions.md` on disk): scenario headings plus per-scenario `- [ ] RED / GREEN / REFACTOR` sub-checkboxes. test-definitions.md is the R/G/R ledger. The prompt hook parses those checkboxes to inject TDD-step guidance during implement, and they enforce one-commit-per-step discipline. Do not duplicate Given/When/Then here when a `.feature` source exists.

```gherkin
Feature: Description of feature

  @<jtbd-id>.R1
  Rule: <jtbd-id>.R1 — Description of the business invariant

    Scenario: Partition A
      Given [context]
      When [action]
      Then [outcome]

    @rejection
    Scenario: Partition B (invariant violated)
      Given [context]
      When [action]
      Then [outcome]
```

```markdown
# Test Definitions: Description of feature

Feature source: `features/<slug>.feature`

test-definitions.md is the R/G/R ledger.

## Rule: <jtbd-id>.R1 — Description of the business invariant

### Scenario: Partition A

- [ ] RED
- [ ] GREEN
- [ ] REFACTOR

### Scenario: Partition B (invariant violated)

- [ ] RED
- [ ] GREEN
- [ ] REFACTOR
```

### Scenario construction rules

Write each saved `.feature` scenario to these rules — they head off at authoring time the defects the scenario-gate would otherwise catch later. Coaching, not a gate: when a scenario starts to break one, split it on the spot instead of accumulating violations.

- **One behavior, one `When`** — each scenario specifies a single event and its outcome. Multiple `And`-joined `Then` lines are fine when they assert facets of the _same_ outcome (a withdrawal that debits **and** dispenses **and** returns the card); a second `When`, or a second behavior, means a second scenario.
- **Outcome-oriented `Then`** — assert what is true after the `When`, never how the system gets there. "Then the order is rejected" ✓, not "Then `validateOrder()` returns false" ✗.
- **Declarative, business language** — name the intent, not the UI mechanics. "When the customer submits the order" ✓, not "When the user clicks `#submit` and waits 200ms" ✗. Reads as living documentation and survives implementation changes.
- **`Given` is state, not action** — establish the world, don't act in it. "Given the cart holds one item" ✓, not "Given the customer adds an item" ✗ (an action belongs in `When`).
- **No `or` in the `Then`** — one outcome per scenario; "returns 200 **or** 201" is two scenarios. For one behavior across many inputs, use a `Scenario Outline` with an `Examples` table, not copy-pasted scenarios.
- **Keep acceptance examples representative** — scenarios cover externally meaningful behavior partitions and boundaries, not every parser permutation or corruption mechanism. Put exhaustive schema, arithmetic, malformed-field, and implementation-level matrices in table-driven lower-level tests.
- **Keep one numbered Rule boundary** — for a scenario under a numbered Rule, every asserted outcome must prove that enclosing Rule. If a `Then` also proves an independently valuable invariant owned by another Rule, split it into that Rule's scenario. Unnumbered grouping Rules and scenarios without lineage keep the exemptions below.
- **Keep outlines coherent** — rows vary one behavioral dimension and retain the same outcome shape. Unrelated defect mechanisms that merely share a generic rejection belong in separate scenarios or lower-level contract matrices.

Two of these rules mirror gate checks — **one behavior** is AODI's **Atomic**, and externally-observable outcomes are its **Observable** (both in the Scenario Quality Gate below). Author for them here; the gate still validates every scenario adversarially.

### Scenario naming: lineage scheme

Each saved `.feature` scenario carries the criterion it proves as a
Gherkin tag, so the link back to the Rule (or legacy AC), JTBD, and persona is
machine-checkable rather than eyeballed:

`@<jtbd-id>.R<#>` — the tag is the numbered-Rule id from intake
(`<slug>.<persona-code><JTBD#>.R<#>`); legacy specs use `.AC<#>`. Long ids are
fine — no truncation. Scenario names may be plain English; keep lineage in tags,
not names.

Worked example — feature `oauth-flow`, persona Platform Operator (PLO), first JTBD:

| Layer        | Id                    |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| JTBD         | `oauth-flow.PLO1`     |
| Rule         | `oauth-flow.PLO1.R2`  |
| Scenario tag | `@oauth-flow.PLO1.R2` |

```text
@oauth-flow.PLO1.R2
Scenario: Change association applies to subsequent auth
```

A scenario with no lineage tag is left alone — it simply proves no criterion.
`safeword doctor` reads the tags and reports coverage gaps for in-progress tickets
as advisories (never a gate):

- **uncovered** — a Rule (or AC) in `spec.md` that no scenario references.
- **stale ref** — a scenario whose JTBD exists but whose `R<#>`/`AC<#>` does not
  (a typo, or a criterion that was renumbered).
- **orphan** — a scenario whose JTBD is absent from `spec.md` entirely.

### Numbered Rules (the default tier)

Numbered Rules are the recommended criteria kind — testable business
invariants with stable per-JTBD IDs, stated generally and illustrated by the
scenarios nested under them. Writing `#### <jtbd-id>.R<n>` headings under a JTBD
puts it on rule lineage; there is no config flag, and a JTBD carries one criteria
kind, never both (`safeword doctor` flags a mixed job as an issue). Legacy specs
may still use Acceptance Criteria instead (soft-deprecated).

- **Spec catalog:** `#### <jtbd-id>.R<n> — <invariant>` headings under the JTBD,
  exactly where AC headings sit (e.g. `#### webhook-retry.PLO1.R1 — a failed
delivery retries on exponential backoff`). IDs are 1-indexed per job and
  numbering-locked after review — renumbering breaks references on purpose.
- **Feature file:** the `Rule:` block carries the literal `@<jtbd-id>.R<n>` tag
  (authoritative — scenarios inherit it as their single lineage ref) and repeats
  the ID as its name's first token for readability; a mismatch is a lint issue.
  An AC-shaped tag always wins the ref parse, so persona code `R` stays safe
  (`@feat.R1.AC1` is an AC of JTBD `feat.R1`).
- **Rejection paths:** tag at least one scenario per rule `@rejection` (the
  example proving the system refuses when the invariant is violated); a numbered
  rule without one draws a check advisory. Unnumbered `Rule:` grouping headers
  are exempt from all of this.
- **Selection:** `cucumber-js --tags @<jtbd-id>.R<n>` runs exactly that rule's
  examples.
- **Coverage:** the uncovered / stale ref / orphan advisories work for rule refs
  exactly as for AC refs.
- **Migrating a rule-numbered corpus** (e.g. Arcade-style split tags): the Rule
  blocks, IDs, and nesting survive as-is; respell tags mechanically —
  `@job:PLO1 @rule:PLO1.R1 @scenario:<name>` on a scenario becomes the single
  block-level `@<slug>.PLO1.R1` tag, and scenario names go back to plain English.

### Define Behavior Exit

1. **Save scenarios** to the feature lane: `features/<slug>.feature` (under `paths.features` when configured)
2. **Save the R/G/R ledger** to `<namespace-root>/tickets/{ID}-{slug}/test-definitions.md`
3. **Update frontmatter:** `phase: scenario-gate`
4. **Work log:** the phase hook stamps the transition with real time (Claude Code — on other harnesses add a short transition entry yourself); optionally add a narrative entry (scenario count, rules covered).

## Scenario Quality Gate

**Entry:** Agent enters `scenario-gate` phase.

Run the **`/review-spec`** skill — it is the gate procedure (vacuous-pass, AODI, determinism risks, adversarial pass + negative-case, cross-cutting checks, and the findings format). It reads the active ticket's `.feature` source when present, using `test-definitions.md` only as the R/G/R ledger, reports findings, and is re-invokable standalone after scenario edits. Its final reconciliation maps material dimensions, affected surfaces, and declared public outcomes to scenarios or explicit deferrals, then challenges whether the planned proof exercises the boundary each load-bearing scenario claims. Apply its findings, then complete the plain-language completeness check and exit below.

### Are the reviewed scenarios complete?

Ask the user: **Do these scenarios now fully cover the intended behavior and important boundaries, or is anything still missing?** If the adversarial pass or user feedback produced new scenarios, loop back to define-behavior. When nothing is missing, the quality gate is complete.

### Scenario Gate Exit

1. Each scenario passes the vacuous-pass test and AODI (Atomic, Observable, Deterministic, Independent)
2. Adversarial pass + cross-cutting checks complete, including coverage reconciliation and the proof-claim challenge; findings presented in the findings format (or confirmed clean)
3. **Check for one build-only kill-risk.** Run this checkpoint only here, after
   items 1–2 pass — never during intake, define-behavior, or while scenario
   validation is incomplete. While items 1–2 are incomplete, remain in
   `scenario-gate`. An eligible risk is one that documentation and
   repository code cannot settle, whose failure would materially change the
   plan, and that a bounded executable proof can answer. If one exists, offer
   `/spike` as the next action. Remain in `scenario-gate`; do not set or advance
   to `plan-implementation`, and do not invoke the spike automatically. Wait for
   the user's explicit choice. If invoked, continue only after its evidence is
   ready to distill. If the user declines, proceed directly to the next item.
   If no eligible risk exists, continue without offering `/spike` and update
   frontmatter directly to `phase: plan-implementation` in the next item.
4. **Update frontmatter:** `phase: plan-implementation` — implementation design (the impl-plan, proof plan, build order, ADR work) happens there; see `PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
5. **Work log:** the phase hook stamps the transition with real time (Claude Code — on other harnesses add a short transition entry yourself); optionally add a narrative entry (validation outcome, proof-plan highlights).

### Optional: codify the scenarios

After the gate, `safeword project codify <ticket>` derives implementation stubs from the `.feature` source — a front-loaded "N tests to make pass" board, instead of writing each test at its RED step. Cucumber acceptance proof still comes from matching step definitions and `test:bdd`. When `.safeword/config.json` sets `bdd.conventions`, read that doc and follow its stub shape, verification lane, and tag rules over these defaults.

- Default: a native vitest skeleton — one `describe` per rule, `it.todo` per scenario (`--red` for failing bodies); print to stdout or `--out <path>`.
- `--format gherkin`: prints the feature source when one exists; on legacy tickets, emits a migration `.feature` from markdown scenarios.

Either way `.feature` is the scenario source of truth. test-definitions.md is the R/G/R ledger for checkboxes and hooks.

**Avoid bloat.**
