# BDD Orchestrator

Behavior-first development for features. Discovery → Scenarios → Implementation.

Define the behavior before implementing it. When unsure whether work is a feature, default to a task (TDD directly) — the user can `/bdd` to override.

## Phase Tracking

Features progress through phases. Track in ticket frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: feature
phase: implement # intake | define-behavior | scenario-gate | plan-implementation | implement | verify | done
---
```

**Phase meanings:**

| Phase                 | What happens                    | Details                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `intake`              | Context check, discovery        | DISCOVERY.md           |
| `define-behavior`     | Writing Given/When/Then         | SCENARIOS.md           |
| `scenario-gate`       | Validating scenarios            | SCENARIOS.md           |
| `plan-implementation` | Implementation design record    | PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION.md |
| `implement`           | Outside-in TDD                  | TDD.md                 |
| `verify`              | Evidence gate: /verify + /audit | VERIFY.md              |
| `done`                | Close ticket                    | DONE.md                |

**Update phase when:**

- Completing a BDD phase → set next phase
- Scenario-gate complete → offer the optional `/spike` checkpoint only for an eligible build-only kill-risk, then set `plan-implementation` (impl-plan authoring, proof plan + sequencing live there)
- Plan reviewed (impl-plan.md valid, status planned) → set `implement`
- All scenarios pass → set `verify`
- /verify + /audit complete (verify.md exists) → set `done`

### Phase-exit review (Tier 2)

The **scenario-gate exit requires** an independent review of the scenarios — not
your own pass. (Your own inline pass is Tier 1: `/self-review`, per asset, as you
author.) Invoke the shared host-owned coordinator with only the phase artifacts
and ticket scope; its typed verdict decides. Resolve a review-capable Safeword
CLI first; source checkouts do not guarantee a bare `safeword` on `PATH`:

```bash
bun .safeword/hooks/run-review.ts review run scenario-gate feature-file ticket-spec [legacy-test-definitions] --agent-handoff --json
```

The coordinator prefers the opposite headless agent and labels a permitted
same-agent fallback as degraded. Only when its typed result is
`REVIEW_ROUTES_EXHAUSTED`, invoke `/finish-review` immediately with the original
result and the same accepted targets. For every other result, return it
unchanged; do not bypass it with another private subagent. On a result that
satisfies the configured policy, record the returned provenance in the stamp
(substitute the four values from `data` in the coordinator result):

```bash
bun .safeword/hooks/write-review-stamp.ts --author-agent "author-agent" --reviewer-agent "actual-reviewer" --independence "independence" --phase phase-name
```

If the reviewer finds blocking issues, fix them and re-review — don't stamp.

All BDD review exits share one lifecycle rule: `REVIEW_PENDING` is a live
review, not a verdict. Keep its `review_id`, collect it through the returned
typed `nextActions` until terminal, and never start a replacement review or
advance/stamp while it is pending. `REVIEW_STALE` means rerun against the
current artifacts. Only a terminal verdict may advance the phase.

The plan-implementation exit applies the same discipline to the implementation plan (see PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION.md's exit). Other phase exits don't need an independent review by default — they carry their
own guards (intake's user sub-phase gates, implement's tests, the done-gate's
evidence checks). When the **review gate** is enabled (`reviewGate` in
`.safeword/config.json` — e.g. autonomous runs where user gates auto-confirm,
ticket 2VCSZY), every phase advance requires a stamp, or a logged skip reason
(`… --phase <phase> --skip "<why no independent review is needed>"`).

## Resume Logic

**Resuming** means reconstruct where the ticket left off and continue. The ticket's `phase:` and the first unchecked ledger item tell you _where_; the last work-log entry tells you _what_. Announce where you're resuming, then continue.

**Resume by phase:**

| Phase                 | Resume action                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `intake`              | Start understanding (propose-and-converge)                |
| `define-behavior`     | Continue drafting scenarios                               |
| `scenario-gate`       | Continue validating scenarios                             |
| `plan-implementation` | Continue the implementation plan (PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION.md) |
| `implement`           | Find first unchecked scenario, run TDD                    |
| `verify`              | Run /verify and /audit, write verify.md                   |
| `done`                | Close ticket (verify.md must exist)                       |

---

## Current Behavior

Understand first and size internally (see SAFEWORD.md "Understanding" and "Sizing") — state the scope read inside your proposal, not as a separate announcement. If the user references an iteration/story/phase from a spec, resume its child ticket at the current phase, or create one and run full BDD if none exists; if a ticket already exists, read its phase and resume there.

**Artifact-first:** before doing a phase's work, create or verify its artifact — intake → `<namespace-root>/tickets/{ID}-{slug}/ticket.md`; define-behavior → the feature source at `features/<slug>.feature` (or the configured `paths.features` directory) plus the R/G/R ledger at `<namespace-root>/tickets/{ID}-{slug}/test-definitions.md`. Then execute the phase using its phase file, and update `phase:` on transition.

## Phase Files

Load the appropriate file based on current phase:

| Phase                 | File                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `intake`              | DISCOVERY.md           |
| `define-behavior`     | SCENARIOS.md           |
| `scenario-gate`       | SCENARIOS.md           |
| `plan-implementation` | PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION.md |
| `implement`           | TDD.md                 |
| `verify`              | VERIFY.md              |
| `done`                | DONE.md                |
