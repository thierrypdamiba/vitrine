# Verify

Prove a ticket meets its criteria. Works with or without an active ticket.

**Reviewer class:** _class-2 — independent observation_: the test suite and parsers are the independent party, so no fresh-context or cross-model reviewer applies.

## Closing Check, Not Fast Feedback

`/verify` is the closing gate: it prefers the project's authoritative suite over
a fast subset. If the project exposes only `test:done`, record that limited
evidence rather than calling it a full run. While implementing, use focused
tests and relevant static checks; before handing work back, run the project's
smoke lane when it has one. Do not substitute smoke for `/verify` when proving
ticket completion.

## Invocation log

This skill is required before marking a feature ticket done. The line below appends a current-run entry to `skill-invocations.log` under the project namespace root (`.project/`, or legacy `.safeword-project/` where that exists) so the done-gate hook can verify /verify was actually invoked. Claude Code expands the `!` line automatically and passes `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` when available. The helper also resolves Claude remote-container ids from the runtime environment, and on Cursor and Codex the pre-shell hook (beforeShellExecution / PreToolUse) bridges the session id to the helper — so on all three runtimes the fallback runs without hand-picking an id. Hand-writing verify.md cannot produce this feature-gate proof.

!`PROJECT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}" && bun "$PROJECT_DIR/.safeword/hooks/record-skill-invocation.ts" "$PROJECT_DIR" verify "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-}" || echo "[skill-invocation-log] FAILED - no current-run proof logged"`

If no `[skill-invocation-log] verify ✓` line appears above, run this fallback before continuing:

```bash
PROJECT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2> /dev/null || pwd)}"
bun "$PROJECT_DIR/.safeword/hooks/record-skill-invocation.ts" "$PROJECT_DIR" verify "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-}"
```

**If the automatic line or fallback prints `[skill-invocation-log] FAILED`, prints `no run identity`, or still does not print `verify ✓`**: a feature ticket can't be marked done without this proof — don't hand-write verify.md as a substitute. Report the failure to the user (most likely cause: inline shell execution was denied, the runtime did not expose a usable run identity, or Bun could not run the installed helper) and ask them to resolve it before re-invoking /verify.

For task, patch, or no-ticket work, this proof isn't required — note it's missing and continue.

## Instructions

### 1. Find Current Ticket (if any)

Use the installed resolver. It reconciles this runtime's session binding with
the current PR or worktree's Git changes and fails closed when those signals
conflict. It never scans the global `in_progress` backlog. A session-bound
ticket remains relevant after its status changes during closeout; a changed
`done` ticket remains eligible.

```bash
PROJECT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2> /dev/null || pwd)}"
bun "$PROJECT_DIR/.safeword/hooks/resolve-verify-ticket.ts" "$PROJECT_DIR"
```

If Safeword's injected context names a ticket but the host exposes no runtime
identity to the helper, rerun with `--ticket <id>`. Multiple changed tickets
fail closed with the same instruction. No candidate means continue without an
active ticket.

Git cannot infer current work from commits made directly on an up-to-date
default branch because there is no distinct merge-base range. In that case,
pass `--ticket <id>` when ticket context is required.

If a ticket is found, read it to get:

- `parent:` field (if any)
- Ticket ID/slug for test-definitions lookup

If no ticket is found, skip scenario validation (step 3) and parent check (step 4).

### 2. Run Automated Checks

Run these in sequence, reporting each result:

1. **Run `/lint`** to auto-fix style issues first
2. Then run target-project verification checks from project evidence.

**Safeword runtime vs target project:** Safeword may use Bun for installed helpers such as `.safeword/hooks/*.ts`; that does not mean the target project uses Bun. Use Bun for installed helpers, then choose target project verification commands from stack manifests, lockfiles, and available scripts. A `package.json` may be safeword lane-host evidence in pure Python, Rust, and Go installs, so do not treat `package.json` as proof the target project is only JavaScript.

Per-language test/build/typecheck/bdd/deps commands all come from `safeword
test-plan` — one source of truth (the same plan the stop-hook gate runs). Eval its
shell plan in a child shell: an absent toolchain prints a visible skip, and a
failing suite exits non-zero so the gate blocks. The Gherkin acceptance lane is
resolved the same way (`--kind bdd`): cucumber-js / behave get their own lane,
while godog and cucumber-rs fold into the Go/Rust test lanes and need no separate
command.

**Run the block below verbatim, as ONE bash invocation.** Do not extract or paraphrase individual commands — the CLI resolver, the generator exit-code check inside `run_plan`, and the git preflight are load-bearing (regressions 487, 375, and 469 each came from a hand-rolled variant of this block).

```bash
PROJECT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2> /dev/null || pwd)}"
cd "$PROJECT_DIR" || exit 1

# Local evidence preflight: many repo tests create throwaway git repos. Some

The `/lint` command handles linting with auto-fix. Report any remaining unfixable errors. Aggregate every attempted stack test into the final `**Test Suite:**` status, and every attempted stack build into the final `**Build:**` status. **Typecheck is part of the gate, not optional:** when the ticket changed TypeScript, a passing targeted-test run is not "ready" until `test-plan --kind typecheck` (or `/lint`, which runs `tsc --noEmit`) is green — CI's lint job runs it and will go red otherwise. A skipped or empty test-plan is not a failure when the project lacks a matching automated check; it is an explicit evidence gap to mention when the ticket touched that stack.

If `LOCAL_EVIDENCE_LIMITS` is non-empty, keep running checks that can run, but classify affected failures as `⚠️ Local environment limitation: <reason>`. The common Cursor sandbox symptom is `.git/hooks/: Operation not permitted` during `git init`. A failure caused only by that preflight is not proof of product failure; confirm outside the sandbox or in CI before calling it real.

If a full Vitest suite fails only because `packages/cli/tests/integration/cucumber-bdd.test.ts` times out while `bun run --cwd packages/cli test:bdd` passes directly, classify it as `⚠️ Local environment limitation: Cucumber wrapper timed out under full-suite load`. Report the isolated Cucumber lane as the Gherkin evidence and rerun that direct lane once. Treat it as a real product failure only when the direct Cucumber lane fails or CI reproduces it.

Regression fixtures covered by `safeword project test-plan` and its tests:

- **no-build JavaScript:** a `test` script with no `build` script runs tests and has no JavaScript build entry.
- **non-Bun JavaScript:** lockfiles and `packageManager` select the matching package manager instead of assuming Bun.
- **non-JavaScript installs:** Python, Rust, and Go manifests are resolved independently of any safeword lane-host `package.json`.

### 3. Validate Test Definitions (skip if no ticket)

1. Find matching file: `$NS_ROOT/tickets/{ID}-{slug}/test-definitions.md`
2. Count scenarios: total `- [` lines
3. Count completed: `- [x]` lines
4. Report: "Scenarios: X/Y complete"

If any unchecked `[ ]` remain, list them.

### 4. Check Parent Epic (skip if no ticket)

If ticket has `parent:` field:

1. Read parent ticket
2. Get `children:` array
3. Check each child's `status:`
4. Report: "Siblings: X/Y done"

### 5. Check Dependency Drift

Compare the project's declared dependencies against `ARCHITECTURE.md`:

1. If `ARCHITECTURE.md` does not exist, skip this check
2. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` content
3. Read the project's dependency manifest(s) — whichever exist:
   - **JS/TS:** `package.json` `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
   - **Python:** `pyproject.toml` (`[project]` `dependencies`, `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`) or `requirements.txt`
   - **Go:** the `require` block in `go.mod`
   - **Rust:** `[dependencies]` (and `[dev-dependencies]`) in `Cargo.toml`
4. For each dependency name:
   - Extract the bare name (drop the `@scope/` prefix for JS, version/path specifiers for the others); check both full and short forms
   - Check if `ARCHITECTURE.md` mentions it (case-insensitive)
5. Flag any runtime/architectural dependency NOT mentioned: `"Dependency \`{name}\` not documented in ARCHITECTURE.md"`

Do NOT flag:

- Type-only packages (`@types/*`) and standard-library imports
- Tooling/dev dependencies (linters, formatters, test utils — across any language) — only flag deps that represent architectural choices

### 6. Check PR Scope (skip if no ticket)

Compare the final change set against the ticket's `scope`, `out_of_scope`, and `done_when`.

Use the best available diff:

- Active PR diff, when the user gave one.
- Otherwise branch diff against the upstream/default branch, plus uncommitted changes.
- If no base is knowable, inspect `git status --short` and the commits/files touched this session.

Flag any changed file or behavior that only serves a different outcome than the ticket. Required supporting cleanup is fine. Nice-to-have refactors, opportunistic fixes, drive-by docs edits, and follow-up discoveries are separate tickets/PRs.

If PR scope fails, do not collapse to "Ready to mark done." Put the concrete split/revert/follow-up action in **Agent's next actions**, or put the scope decision in **Decisions needed** when the user must decide whether to expand the ticket.

### 7. Write verify.md (skip if no ticket)

The done gate blocks on this **artifact**, not on your chat report: `<ticket folder>/verify.md` must exist and contain a `**PR Scope:**` line whose status is passing (`done-gate.ts` rejects `❌`/piggybacked). Write the full Status checklist (step 8's Verify Checklist block, every line) to `$NS_ROOT/tickets/{ID}-{slug}/verify.md`, and once /audit has run, include its one-line result (`Audit passed …`) there too.

The all-green collapse in step 8 applies to the **chat report only** — verify.md always carries the full checklist, even when everything is green.

### 8. Report Results

Structure the report in three sections, in this order. **Empty sections are hidden entirely** — no "None" placeholders, no empty headers.

#### Status (the existing Verify Checklist — facts only)

The Status section uses the existing Verify Checklist format. Format with these EXACT patterns (the done-gate hook validates them):

```
## Verify Checklist

**Test Suite:** ✓ X/X tests pass (or ❌ N failures, or ⚠️ Local environment limitation: <reason>, or ⏭️ Skipped — no test suite)
**Gherkin:** ✅ Acceptance lane passes (or ❌ Failed, or ⚠️ Local environment limitation: <reason>, or ⏭️ Skipped — no acceptance lane detected)
**Build:** ✅ Success (or ❌ Failed, or ⏭️ Skipped — no build step)
**Lint:** ✅ Clean (or ❌ N errors)
**Scenarios:** All N scenarios marked complete (or ❌ X/Y complete, or ⏭️ Skipped — no ticket)
**PR Scope:** ✅ Diff matches ticket scope (or ❌ Piggybacked changes: <paths/behaviors>, or ⏭️ Skipped — no ticket/diff)
**Dep Drift:** ✅ Clean (or ⚠️ N undocumented deps, or ⏭️ Skipped — no ARCHITECTURE.md/package.json)
**Parent Epic:** {id} (siblings: X/Y done) or N/A
**Reconcile:** ✅ No pattern deviation (or ⚠️ N deviations, M missing uplevel ticket — soft, never blocks)
**Experience:** ✅ No new friction (or ⚠️ N friction points / dulled peak, or ⏭️ N/A — not persona-facing) — soft, never blocks
**Surface Evidence:** ✅ N/N affected surfaces have recorded proof (or ⚠️ N unproven/limited, or ⏭️ N/A — no affected surfaces)
**Evidence limits:** ✅ None (or ⚠️ <local limitation>; affected failures are not product evidence until reproduced outside the limit)
```

**PR Scope** is the final "one purpose" guard. It blocks the all-green collapse: if it is ❌, the ticket is not ready to mark done until the unrelated work is reverted, split into another ticket/PR, or explicitly accepted as a scope change and reflected in the ticket artifacts.

**Reconcile** is soft — it never blocks the done gate. If the work introduced a pattern that diverges from existing siblings (see `.safeword/guides/architecture-guide.md` → Survey & Reconcile), confirm the ticket carries a reconcile record and every deviation has an uplevel follow-up ticket; flag any that don't. Use `N/A` when the work conformed or introduced no new pattern.

**Experience** is soft — it never blocks the done gate (no done-gate evidence pattern; a ⚠️ never hard-blocks `done`). Run it for persona-facing work; use `N/A` for internal/plumbing. You are grading your own work here, so the walk-artifact below is mandatory — a bare `✅` or "feels clean" is exactly the self-rating it exists to defeat. Two lenses:

- **Friction (every persona-facing feature):** did this add a step, a wait, a re-entry, or a dead-end the persona didn't have before? Walk the changed flow as the persona, inspect its _ending_ specifically, and **record the walk as evidence, not a verdict:** `Walked <persona> through <flow>; worst step = <the one most likely to make them bounce>; new steps vs before = <n>`. Name the _worst_ step, not a tidy summary.
- **Peak (only when the ticket or its parent declared a `## Rave Moment` in `spec.md`):** walk that moment as the persona — does it still land, and did this work advance or endanger it? A peak that quietly degraded is a finding even when every test is green.

A ⚠️ Experience finding routes to **Agent's next actions** if you'll fix it now, or to **Decisions needed** if it's a scope/value call for the user. It is never a reason to hold `done` on its own.

**Surface evidence** records what actually ran, not just scenario tags. For each
affected surface in `spec.md`, add a compact matrix row with **Affected
surface**, **proof command or manual check**, and **result**. Use the real
runtime/client/protocol/deployment boundary where available; otherwise record a
`skip: <reason>` and carry the limitation into Evidence limits. This matrix is
the input quality review uses to challenge parity.

**Done-gate evidence patterns** (the stop hook validates these literal phrases — do not move or rename):

- `✓ X/X tests pass` — proves test suite ran
- `**Gherkin:**` — proves the acceptance lane ran or was explicitly skipped
- `All N scenarios marked complete` — proves scenarios checked
- `**PR Scope:**` — proves the final diff was checked against ticket scope
- `Audit passed` — proves /audit ran (run /audit separately)

Without the required patterns in Status, the done phase will hard block.

#### Decisions needed (spec / scope / value)

Only include this section when there are spec, scope, or value questions the USER must answer.

**Implementation-path questions (which approach, which pattern, which library) do NOT go here — they belong in "Agent's next actions" because the agent owns implementation choices.**

Borderline classification examples:

- "Should we use NextAuth or Lucia for auth?" → implementation-path → goes in **Actions** (agent picks one with reasoning, user can override).
- "Should this endpoint be at /v1/projects or /v2/projects?" → value decision (API contract) → goes in **Decisions**.
- "Is R5.x in scope for this slice or punt to slice 4?" → scope decision → goes in **Decisions**.
- "Should we extract this helper or inline it?" → implementation-path → goes in **Actions**.
- "Is 4xx the right HTTP status for this error?" → spec decision (if the spec exists, look it up; otherwise it's a value call) → goes in **Decisions**.

**Hard cap of 5 items** per section. If more exist, list the top 5 (most load-bearing) and add:

> - N others, see test-definitions.md

**Decisions section is hidden when empty** — no "None" placeholder. Do not surface the section at all if zero decisions exist.

#### Agent's next actions

Only include this section when there are concrete forward actions the agent will take. Each action must be **concrete and falsifiable** — not vague exploration ("look into X"), but a specific verb + object the agent will execute ("add integration test for R7.3 covering 404-on-uncovered-PATCH").

**Hard cap of 5 items** per section. If more exist, list the top 5 and add:

> - N others, see test-definitions.md

**Actions section is hidden when empty** — no "None" placeholder.

#### All-green collapse

When **all Status checks pass, PR Scope is ✅/skipped for a valid reason, Evidence limits is ✅ None, AND zero decisions AND zero actions**, collapse the entire report to a single-line verdict:

> Ready to mark done.

No sections, no ceremony. Single line.

## Summary

This command verifies ticket criteria (the done gate). Use it before marking any feature ticket complete. It also works without a ticket for quick project health checks (tests + build + lint + dep drift).
